Three Tier Architecture On AWS

-->Presentation Layer:

1. Subnets:

In the presentation layer, subnets are used to group together instances that handle user interactions and client-side components, such as web servers or application servers.

Typically, public subnets are used in this layer because they allow instances to have direct access to the internet. This is important for serving web applications to users.

2. Security Groups:

Security groups are applied to instances in the presentation layer to control inbound and outbound traffic.

Inbound security group rules are configured to allow specific types of traffic, such as HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443), from specific sources (e.g., the internet) to reach the instances.

Outbound security group rules may be configured to allow these instances to communicate with other layers or external services, such as a database server.

3. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):

ELB is a crucial component of the presentation layer. It distributes incoming user requests and traffic across multiple instances (usually web servers) to ensure high availability and scalability.

ELB can be placed in a public subnet, acting as the entry point for user requests, and can distribute traffic to instances in private subnets.

4. Auto Scaling Group:

Auto Scaling groups are used in the presentation layer to automatically add or remove instances based on demand.

When the load on web servers increases, new instances are launched to handle the load. When the load decreases, excess instances are terminated to save costs.

Auto Scaling groups work seamlessly with ELB to ensure that new instances are automatically registered and available for incoming traffic.

--> Example Scenario:

Let's say you are hosting a web application on AWS:

Your web servers (part of the presentation layer) are placed in public subnets to allow direct internet access.

Security groups for the web servers restrict inbound traffic to only HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) from the internet.

You configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in a public subnet. The ALB distributes incoming user requests to the web servers in the private subnets.

You create an Auto Scaling group for the web servers to handle varying levels of traffic. As user demand increases, the Auto Scaling group launches additional web server instances and registers them with the ALB.

In this scenario, subnets, security groups, Elastic Load Balancers, and Auto Scaling groups in the presentation layer work together to ensure the web application is highly available, scalable, and secure, while also managing the network configuration for user interactions.

Certainly! Let's discuss how components like subnets, security groups, Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), and Auto Scaling groups are typically used in the application layer of a 3-tier architecture:

--> Application Layer:

1. Subnets:

In the application layer, subnets are used to host the application servers or microservices. These application servers are responsible for processing business logic and application-specific functionality.

It's common to place application servers in private subnets to enhance security by isolating them from direct internet access.

2. Security Groups:

Security groups are applied to instances in the application layer to control inbound and outbound traffic.

Inbound security group rules are configured to allow traffic from specific sources (e.g., the presentation layer) to reach the application servers on the required ports.

Outbound security group rules may be configured to allow application servers to communicate with other layers, such as the data layer (e.g., a database server) or external services.

3. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):

ELB can be used in the application layer to distribute incoming requests among multiple application server instances for load balancing and high availability.

Application Load Balancers (ALBs) are commonly used in this layer because they can route requests based on content, such as HTTP headers or URL paths, to different application servers or microservices.

4. Auto Scaling Group:

Auto Scaling groups can also be utilized in the application layer to manage the number of application server instances based on demand.

As the workload increases, new application server instances are automatically launched and added to the load balancer pool. Conversely, during periods of lower demand, excess instances can be terminated to save costs.

--> Example Scenario:

Let's consider an e-commerce website as an example:

The application layer hosts the e-commerce application servers that handle tasks like processing customer orders, managing user profiles, and inventory management.

These application servers are placed in private subnets to prevent direct access from the internet, enhancing security.

Security groups are configured to allow inbound traffic from the presentation layer (e.g., web servers) on specific ports relevant to the application's APIs and services.

An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is set up in the private subnet to distribute incoming API requests among the application server instances.

An Auto Scaling group is associated with the application servers to automatically adjust the number of instances based on the number of incoming requests or load, ensuring the application remains responsive and available.

In this application layer scenario, subnets, security groups, Elastic Load Balancers (specifically ALBs), and Auto Scaling groups collaborate to ensure that the application is highly available, scalable, and secure, while also managing the network configuration for application-specific logic and processing.

Certainly! Let's explore how components like subnets, security groups, Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), and Auto Scaling groups are typically used in the data layer of a 3-tier architecture:

--> Data Layer:

1. Subnets:

In the data layer, subnets are used to host databases, data storage systems, and other data-related resources.

For enhanced security, it's common to place data layer components in private subnets that are isolated from direct internet access. This isolation helps protect sensitive data.

2. Security Groups:

Security groups play a critical role in controlling access to the data layer. They are applied to database instances, data storage servers, and other data-related resources.

Inbound security group rules are configured to allow specific application servers or application components (e.g., those in the application layer) to access the data layer on the necessary ports.

Outbound security group rules can be used to specify which outbound traffic is allowed from the data layer, such as allowing outbound traffic to specific services or IP ranges.

3. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):

In some cases, you might use an ELB, such as a Network Load Balancer (NLB), to distribute read-heavy database queries or traffic across multiple database instances.

An NLB can be placed in front of read replicas or database clusters to ensure that read queries are distributed efficiently.

4. Auto Scaling Group:

While Auto Scaling is commonly associated with compute instances, it can also be relevant in the data layer. For example, if you have read replicas in a database cluster, you can configure Auto Scaling for these replicas to handle increased read workloads.

Auto Scaling ensures that the data layer can automatically adjust its capacity based on demand, providing scalability and reliability.

Example Scenario:

Consider a scenario for an e-commerce application:

The data layer hosts a relational database that stores customer information, order history, and product catalog data.

Database instances are placed in private subnets to restrict direct access from the internet.

Security groups are configured to allow inbound traffic only from application servers in the application layer, on database-specific ports (e.g., port 3306 for MySQL).

In some cases, an NLB might be used to distribute read queries across read replicas, ensuring efficient use of database resources.

Auto Scaling for read replicas ensures that the data layer can automatically adjust to handle varying read workloads, providing performance and scalability.

In this data layer scenario, subnets, security groups, Elastic Load Balancers (if applicable), and Auto Scaling groups work together to ensure the security, availability, and scalability of the data storage and database resources while managing network configurations for data access and storage.
